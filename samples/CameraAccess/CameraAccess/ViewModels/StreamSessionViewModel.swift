// StreamSessionViewModel.swift
//
// Core view model demonstrating video streaming from Meta wearable devices using the DAT SDK.
// This class showcases the key streaming patterns: device selection, session management,
// video frame handling, photo capture, and error handling.
//
// DAT 0.9 model: a DeviceSession is created and started first, then a Camera is
// added to it and its Stream carries the video. The old single StreamSession
// object (0.4) is gone; this view model keeps the same public surface so the
// views and the LiveKit bridge are unchanged.
